### The Cozy Corner ☕

Welcome to **The Cozy Corner**, a website designed to help you find your perfect local coffee spot. Whether you're a student looking for a quiet place to study, a freelancer in need of a work-friendly cafe, or just someone searching for a cozy atmosphere to relax, this site has you covered.

I built this project to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by creating a functional and responsive single-page application.

### Features

* **Responsive Navigation**: The site features a sticky, responsive navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes, including a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Cafe Display**: The "Featured Spots" section dynamically renders cafe cards using JavaScript, making it easy to add or update new cafes in the `script.js` file without changing the HTML structure.
* **Filtering**: Users can filter cafes based on their desired **vibe** (`Good for Work`, `Cozy & Quiet`, `Bustling & Social`), providing a tailored browsing experience.
* **Interactive Modals**: Clicking on a cafe card opens a modal window that displays detailed information about the selected spot, including its location, hours, and a full description.
* **Clean & Modern Design**: The site uses a warm, inviting color palette and a combination of Google Fonts (`Poppins` and `Lato`) to create a clean and aesthetic user interface.
* **Form Functionality**: The "Contact" section includes a form for users to submit their own cafe recommendations, encouraging community engagement.
